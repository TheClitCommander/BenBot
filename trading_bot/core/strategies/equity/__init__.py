# trading_bot/core/strategies/equity/__init__.py
# This file makes Python treat the `equity` directory as a package.

# Example of how you might import specific equity strategies later:
# from .equity_trend_strategy import EquityTrendStrategy
# from .equity_reversal_strategy import EquityReversalStrategy

# __all__ = ["EquityTrendStrategy", "EquityReversalStrategy"]

# For now, just indicate it's a package
